**semantic-release** automates the whole package release workflow including: determining the next version number, generating the release notes, and publishing the package.

This removes the immediate connection between human emotions and version numbers, strictly following the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) specification and communicating the **impact** of changes to consumers.

## Highlights

- Fully automated release
- Enforce [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) specification
- New features and fixes are immediately available to users
- Notify maintainers and users of new releases
- Use formalized commit message convention to document changes in the codebase
- Publish on different distribution channels (such as [npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag)) based on git merges
- Integrate with your [continuous integration workflow](docs/recipes/release-workflow/README.md#ci-configurations)
- Avoid potential errors associated with manual releases
- Support any [package managers and languages](docs/recipes/release-workflow/README.md#package-managers-and-languages) via [plugins](docs/usage/plugins.md)
- Simple and reusable configuration via [shareable configurations](docs/usage/shareable-configurations.md)

## How does it work?

### Commit message format

**semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact of changes in the codebase.
Following formalized conventions for commit messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.

By default, **semantic-release** uses [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
The commit message format can be changed with the [`preset` or `config` options](docs/usage/configuration.md#options)

Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/nholuongut/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/nholuongut/commitlint) can be used to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages.

The table below shows which commit message gets you which release type when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied`                                                                                                                             | ~~Patch~~ Fix Release                                                                                           |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                                                                                                                                                       | ~~Minor~~ Feature Release                                                                                       |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`<br><br>`BREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.`<br>`The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.` | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release <br /> (Note that the `BREAKING CHANGE: ` token must be in the footer of the commit) |

### Triggering a release

For each new commit added to one of the release branches (for example: `master`, `main`, `next`, `beta`), with `git push` or by merging a pull request or merging from another branch, a CI build is triggered and runs the `semantic-release` command to make a release if there are codebase changes since the last release that affect the package functionalities.

**semantic-release** offers various ways to control the timing, the content and the audience of published releases.
See example workflows in the following recipes:

- [Using distribution channels](docs/recipes/release-workflow/distribution-channels.md#publishing-on-distribution-channels)
- [Maintenance releases](docs/recipes/release-workflow/maintenance-releases.md#publishing-maintenance-releases)
- [Pre-releases](docs/recipes/release-workflow/pre-releases.md#publishing-pre-releases)

### Release steps

After running the tests, the command `semantic-release` will execute the following steps:

| Step              | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Verify Conditions | Verify all the conditions to proceed with the release.                                                                          |
| Get last release  | Obtain the commit corresponding to the last release by analyzing [Git tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging). |
| Analyze commits   | Determine the type of release based on the commits added since the last release.                                                |
| Verify release    | Verify the release conformity.                                                                                                  |
| Generate notes    | Generate release notes for the commits added since the last release.                                                            |
| Create Git tag    | Create a Git tag corresponding to the new release version.                                                                      |
| Prepare           | Prepare the release.                                                                                                            |
| Publish           | Publish the release.                                                                                                            |
| Notify            | Notify of new releases or errors.                                                                                               |
